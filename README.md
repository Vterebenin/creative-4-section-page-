## block about this work
> So, it`s just a simple concept of 4-section page, which contains a interesting blocks. A lot of people don`t want to scrolling too much or reload main pages, and this type of site deals with it. Just click the button and there is the content!

## files to work with code
Name of the file| File content
----------------|----------------------
index.html      | Here you can see the HTML
common.js       | And here you can see the JS code
main.min.css    | Unfortunately, you can't see the main css, but of course you can use your browser inspector. I just write on SASS instead of css.

## and..
_You can always use this idea for your projects. You may	 simply  try to invert background-color, when button-wrapper is hover or maybe you have a better idea. So, feel free and if you want to help me just share my project somewhere._
