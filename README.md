Name of the file| File content
----------------|----------------------
index.html      | Here you can see the HTML
common.js       | And here you can see the JS code
main.min.css    | Unfortunately, you cant see the main css, but you can use your browser inspector for sure. I just write on SASS instead of css




_You can always use this idea for your projects. You can simple like try to invert background-color, when button-wrapper is hover or maybe you have a better idea. So, fell free and if you want to help me just share my project somewhere._
