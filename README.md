## block about this work
> So, its just a simple concept of 4-section page, which contains a interesting blocks. A lot of people dont want to scrolling too much or reload main pages, and this type of site deal with it. Just click the button and here are the content!

## files to work with code
Name of the file| File content
----------------|----------------------
index.html      | Here you can see the HTML
common.js       | And here you can see the JS code
main.min.css    | Unfortunately, you cant see the main css, but you can use your browser inspector for sure. I just write on SASS instead of css

## and..
_You can always use this idea for your projects. You can simple like try to invert background-color, when button-wrapper is hover or maybe you have a better idea. So, fell free and if you want to help me just share my project somewhere._
